# GutsAndGlory

This will eventually be a gore mod, but unfortunately TaleWorlds has yet to expose mesh editing methods in the Bannerlord Engine yet. Initial plans are to simply cut off by bone and explode a limb into pieces with enough force. 

After that, I would like to look into doing dynamic slicing, likely using Raycasting to create a plane that will cut off the mesh following the direction of the blow. Additionally I will look into slices after death, as I believe it feels better to be able to interact "as much as you want" in a sandbox.
